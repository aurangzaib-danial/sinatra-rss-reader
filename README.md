# RSS Reader Made in Sinatra


This is a RSS Reader application or RSS feeds aggregator 

What is RSS?

RSS means Really Simple Syndication which allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. These feeds can, for example, allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator. The news aggregator will automatically check the RSS feed for new content, allowing the content to be automatically passed from website to website or from website to user.

This app is hosted on Heroku https://catchup-rss.herokuapp.com using heroku free plan.

**App might take time to load sometimes. The reason is that heroku puts apps which are on free plan to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. So when you visit the website, the app is waked from sleep which takes a little time!**
